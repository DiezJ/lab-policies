Job Interview advice
(from Chris Eckert, Margaret Ptacek, Locke Rowe, Spencer Barrett,
Judy Stamps and others)

- memorize the grad calendar so you know what everyone does
- read some papers and abstracts of the people on the search
   committee (and abstracts of papers by others   too perhaps) and
   definitely ask them about their research (but   don't deflect
   their questions about your stuff by asking about   their stuff)
- go in with a course outline all set up, including labs, if
   possible (or at least a short syllabus)
- have lots of different ideas about where your research will go
   (long-term research goals) (even if you won't do it in the next
   5 years)
- think about what your philosophy of teaching is
- don't negotiate for anything until you get offered the job
   (i.e. don't even mention salary until then)
- have an answer to "what will you bring to the dept."
- how many grad students and postdocs you envision having
- a local project that would compliment your ongoing research
- mention planned collaborations, possible funding sources (what
   are you eligible besides NSERC, NSF, NIH).  How much money is
   available from that university?
- how many women faculty do they have?
- is it a good dept?  Will you have enough colleagues to interact
   with?  Is the chair 3, 5 years or permanent?
- ask to see the space you would occupy (or floor plans), about
   shared equipment, and potential collaborations

- wait for them to ask you what you need in the way of equipment
   and then you tell them the types of things that you will need.
   But don't discuss an actual bottom line figure.  Most of this
   will be discussed when an offer is made (but they may ask for an
   idea of how much you will need) (it is a good idea to have a
   ballpark estimate of how much money you would need to get
   started on your research)
- don't bring up money matters with respect to salary or startup
   unless they bring it up first.  Try to be casual about these
   things and not make it seem like you really care.
- take notes when you talk to the chairman, dean, etc. (it can be
   easy to forget the details after you've left)
- take a list of questions to ask the chairman (and maybe the
   dean) - they may not cover everything and they seem to like it
   when you have questions (like how grad students are funded,
   about extra pots of money to fund your research, teaching
   loads, how courses are alloted, etc.)
- is there an expiry date on the startup money? are there
   restrictions on how you can spend it (eg on a tech, field
   trips, grad student salaries, postdoc)?

- Would you be willing to teach courses x, y and z.
- if you are leaving another position: why do you want to leave
   that university?
- My best advice is to be interested and keen on what they are doing
   researchwise.  After they ask you some mundane questions, ask them what
   they are doing and pretend you're interested (if you are not honestly
   so).
- Dont bullshit, though

- you're allowed to ask for bathroom breaks

- treat it as a chance to hear about lots of other people's work
- be positive about your life, i.e. about your time doing your
   PhD and your postdoc(s)
- be confident about yourself, your research and your future
- have fun!

The Job Talk (many of these items apply to all talks):
- say thanks for the invitation
* - why is the question important?  (and how it relates to their
   own work), what are the burning questions that are central  to
   your field that you will address now
- often the whole dept will go to the seminar - undergrads,
   grads, everyone
- have a menu as to where you will be going in the seminar
- minimize jargon and never change terms
- drop hints on the stats you used
- use the same order, colours in each experiment (ie replicated
   pattern) to make it as easy as possible for the audience
- make sure your talk covers all aspects of all the things you
   have done, keep the level simple (ie not a lot of nitty  gritty
   details about what you did - lots of overviews of the interesting
   results)
- broadly define the area that you work in
- make it clear at the start why your research is important and
   how your work fits in in the scheme of things
- what are the questions in your area that are important
- why is your group interesting and why they are a good system
   (e.g. guppies - excellent background info, easily reared, short
   life cycle)
- never start out saying 'I am interested in' (they don't care -
   they need to be convinced that it is interesting to them)
- tell them you work at the cutting edge of your area
- identify some general questions early in the talk and give some
   relatively simple messages
- they will be judging your teaching abilities
- don't worry about talking down to the people in your area,
   especially if the whole dept. votes
- max. of 3 ideas per seminar
- drop hints for further conversations (or other seminars)
- it should be a story, an interesting story and how it goes on
   to further adventures
- broaden out at the end e.g. how would these findings apply to
   other spp.
- don't just allude to an experiment - either describe it or only
   give it a very brief mention
- do describe some experiments in detail so the audience can
   judge how you do research
- keep the audience on your theme
- good slides (ie interesting to look at)
- include acknowl. of collaborators?



           Joe Travis' advice on how to apply for a job


Research Interests
- 2 pages, single-spaced at the maximum (Alice's, Tom's etc. are
   too long)
- start broad - general research interests
- what you did for your PhD
- what you did/are doing for your postdoc
   (just a couple of sentences on Het for now, till I have
   results)
- what you plan for the future (get broad again, what is your
   vision for the future, your grand research scheme (not just for
   the next grant, but beyond that)
- don't forget to say why your research is important/interesting


CV
- make sure it is easy to find the following sections -
   education, publications, grants
- no wrap around stuff
- crisp, concise, neat, nice presentation
- publications - 3 sections: out, in press, submitted (no in prep
   section) (you can mention the work in prep in your research
   interests page)

Cover letter
- one or two paragraphs for each of the following sections
- say you would like to apply for their job x.  If you heard
   about the job from a prof (ie they sent out a letter to Joe
   asking him to post it), then say that in the letter
- tell them what you do ("I do evolutionary ecology..." but say
   you describe your interests more fully in your research
   interests page - say how I started with species x... (refer
   them to the cv and enclosed reprint(s)), tell them why what you
   do is cool, how your work fits in with other work being done in
   the discipline.
- say why you are good for the job - how you would fit in, what
   you would add to the department
- say why it would be a great place for you to work - eg to
   collaborate, could thrive there b/c...,
- give your teaching interests (if you have a teaching interests
   enclosure, refer to it (note: don't include anything in your
   application that you haven't been asked for), mention who you
   have observed teaching and what you learned from it
- close (you look forward to hearing from them)

*** read other people's cv's, letters, statements
*** get someone else (those outside your area can be especially
helpful since everyone on the search committee has to understand
your work and why it is important) to read your application



Kiyoko's experience and thoughts:
At the interview they
asked me what my pedagogical philosophy was - I tried to answer that one
but finally said that what I was saying was all bullshit to try to
impress them, that basically I tried in teaching to get students to think
rather than memorize facts and to learn how to solve problems.  When they
asked me if I could teach climatology, I said I had never taken a course
in it but since it was only a first year course, I was sure I could
handle it since I felt I could teach a first year course in anything.
Talk about arrogant, eh?  I think it was the wine that was talking.
     Basically, what a selection committee wants to hear from a
prospective professor is an idea of their planned research program.
Since a PhD thesis and even post-doc research are usually projects within
a supervisor's research program, they want evidence that you can think
beyond a project to plan a whole research program that would involve grad
students.  All of the places I was interviewed also wanted to know what
kind of research I could do locally because they often want you to also
get involved in some local research - for example, that undergraduate
students could do for their honours theses.


Miriam's experiences:

It was a bit weird to begin
my lecturing career with a lecture to 250 students plus the 7 members of the
search committee, especially as they started by handing out assessment forms
for all the students to give appraisals of my performance, and because
the overhead projector was set up in such a way that every time I wrote
something I was blinded.  The course director told me to think of it 
as a hazing.  Hopefully I get to join the club now.

The set-up money discussion started out with near-total ignorance
on my part, raised eyebrows on the department chairman's part, and his
comment that "This is why I talk to candidates before they talk to the
Dean". Of course the Department's interest is that I get as much money as
possible.  The molecular biologist on the committee set me straight and  I
multiplied my request by 10 when I met the Dean.  The search committee
asked me tricky questions like "What do you think is wrong with our
Department?" and "What are your weaknesses?".  To the former I said I
couldn't possibly tell in only two days and if they were still interested
about two years after they hire me I might have an opinion.  To the
latter, I pleaded the Fifth (3 years in the US are taking their toll).


If you get offered the job:
- you can bargain for 1) no teaching first year 2) to stay an
extra year on your postdoc (or whatever you are doing) 3) good
start-up money 4) reasonable lab and office space


Insights from the member of a search commitee at a rather small
American university:
         Howdy.  Well, here's the scoop.  We got down to the "finalists"
>yesterday.  12 people out of 200+!  I'll tell you, it was a weird
>experience, from my perspective.  Some people who I thought were REALLY
>strong didn't make it onto the short list for querky reasons.  A guy
>  (who has published a GREAT deal in good journals on life
>history of insects, and on quant. gen. stuff) didn't make it in because he is
>postdocing in Hawaii, and the chair didn't want to pay to fly him out here!
>Another guy, who also had a sterling record, didn't make
>it in because he worked on fruit dispersal, and people thought that didn't

>SURE this is not the case in a lot of other Univeristies.


After the interview:

>I have been exhausted and depressed after each interview (I don't
>know why the depression.  Post adrenalin crashes?)

Its a huge letdown. You spend all of this physical and emotion energy
getting ready and psyched up, then run on adrenaline and probably miss a
lot of sleeping hours (I never sleep more than a few hours/night) on
interview... and then there is no immediate reward. The committee and
members of the department are typically guarded to the point of rudeness
while the other interviews are going on. Waiting and rewinding and
replaying the tapes of the interview are torture. And if you are not the
chosen one, they put you on ice like a cadaver. Its an awful and inhumane
process.


Your new job (from Judy Stamps)

Are you feeling completely overwelmed yet? I think  I spent my
first year
as assistant professor feeling like I was drowning in a sea of unfamiliar
duties and expectations....But everyone was very supportive (having been
through it themselves) and I got through OK. If you need any gratitious
advice about anything...let me know...


Part of the overwelming feeling is that everything is new, and you are
figuring out a new set of rules at the same time as you are getting used to
a novel environment and people. I guess dispersal to a 'breeding' habitat
from a 'juvenile' habitat is difficult for all animals, including people..
On the other hand, using information from conspecifics can help a great
deal....so do make it a point to offer to take them out to lunch, and then
pump them for information about HOW THINGS WORK....

Exam Advice (Laurence Packer, Dan Fieldhouse, me)
SEE LOCKE'S EMAIL TOO
- think about your answer before you start
- - keep your answers short
- don't' overestimate what they want to know

General Advice

- don't collect data just because you can (what is the question) - Mark McPeek
- during a seminar, remember that people will only be able to 
remember what you told them in the previous sentence (Rob Baker)

Departmental seminar
- don't  aim  your  talk  at  your  mate  (that  will  be   too
   specialized), aim it at the rest of the audience (SCHBarrett)

- plot your data (Lawrence Harder)
- when you about to begin writing, think about how you would tell the 
whole story to someone who is interested and want to hear it all 
(Virginia Morell).
